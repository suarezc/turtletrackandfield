# S.T.R.I.K.E.R 3,000,000 + 1
Final Project for CMSC 20900


## Project Description

* Goal: For this project we aimed to build a robot that could improve it's bowling in our simulated lane through the use of a genetic algorithm. We were able to build a system for training robots to improve their score in bowling by combining our main components into one system. We developed an implementation of bowling in the Gazebo world for which we parameterized certain variables we wished to optimize with our algorithm. The system is built for testing multiple chromosomes at once so we are able to build a genetic algorithm that takes advantage of this parrallelization to produce a satisfactory result.
  * Bowling for Robots: (how the robot bowls and how the lanes were designed) (picture of lanes)
  * Parrellizing Training: (how we got many robots to bowl at once and how the reset mechanism works) (gif of restart)
  * Training with our Genetic Algorithm: (how we use sim training in conjunction with real training to produce our bowling bot) (gif of robot bowling poorly then    robot bowling better)


## System Architecture
